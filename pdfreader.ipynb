These \\nwould be acquired through an educational process guided by the philosophy of Dynamic Filipinism.  \\nThis philosophy has as its guiding tenets, the internalizing all that is good in the Filipino people: warmth, \\nhospitality, innovativeness, and a high emotional quotient that has made Filipinos renowned in service \\noriented industries.”  \\nThis young man, Don Mariano Fortunato Jhocson, guided by this vision, founded Colegio Filipino, now \\nNATIONAL UNIVERSITY on August 01, 1900, in Quiapo, City of Manila. It was the first non – sectarian and \\nco – educational institution then. There were only a handful of students at that time in the fledgling \\nSchool, and they were in the elementary and secondary (High School) lev els. Don Mariano, to help the \\nschool grow, was teacher, director and janitor rolled into one.  \\nIn a short span of 5 years, he offered courses in Business – bookkeeping and accounting, convinced that \\nthus armed, his students would be financially secure and respectable after graduation. This led to the \\nchanging of the name to Colegio Mercantil, awardi ng the diploma of Perito Mercantil. A short time later, \\nthe Philippine Law School was opened with the collaboration of the Lacson brothers. Don Mariano saw \\nthe dire need for training the youth for leadership and responsibility. He firmly believed that the discipline \\nof Law would turn out men and women who would eventually be advocates for Philippine self -\\ngovernment.  \\nIn 1916, the Board of Trustees changed the name from Colegio Mercantil to National Academy. The \\ngrowth of the Academy was continuous, and added Liberal Arts which became the gateway to other \\ndisciplines that followed.  \\nAfter 21 years of educational service, on January 17, 1921, the Board of Trustees applied for and secured \\npermission from the Department of Public Instruction to change the name of the National Academy to \\nNATIONAL UNIVERSITY. On that same day, the Universi ty also installed Senator Camilo Osias, one of the \\nmost respected and outstanding Filipino educators as President of the University.  \\nThereafter, the Colleges of Education and Commerce were opened in the same year. During the following \\nyears, the Colleges of Pharmacy and Dentistry were opened in 1922. The College of Engineering, offering \\ninitially Civil Engineering opened in 1925 and the  Normal School in 1930. Sanitary Engineering was initially \\noffered in 1930.  \\nFrom July 1945, its facilities have since continuously expanded and the following disciplines were added \\n– bachelor’s degrees in chemical , Electrical, Industrial, Mechanical Engineering and Architecture and Arts. \\nMaster in Sanitary Engineering was also organized.

Hence upon very satisfactory performance, the \\nmanagement reserves the right to promote any personnel to a high er position the personnel will \\ndeem fit.  The personnel upon promotion shall enjoy the benefits and salary adjustment of the \\nposition he/she is assigned to.  \\n \\n• Promotion to a higher position may be upon application by the employee or endorsement of \\nthe immediate superior or Unit Director.  The application or endorsement shall be made \\nimmediately once a post is announced open.  \\n• Seniority is not a factor to be considered in promotion but the commensurate abilities and \\nproven performance of the employee.  \\n \\n8.3 The HR Campus Lead  informs the employee and hands over the appointment through the Personnel \\nAction Notice Form.

Job security usually arises from the terms of the employment contract \\nand is discussed in collective bargaining agreement or other labor legislations that prevents arbitrary \\ntermination, layoffs, and lockouts.  \\nIn this regard, National University seeks to provide all regular employees with security of employment \\nconsistent with conditions over which it has control. Hence, it stabilizes employment insofar as practicable \\nthrough careful planning and balancing of op erational requirements.  \\nWhen fluctuations in personnel requirements occur, National University tries to avoid layoffs by \\ntransferring personnel within the institution. Preference will be given to employees having greater \\nseniority provided they have the necessary qualifications.  \\n \\nSECTION 11: SERVICE RECOGNITION  \\nA University wide Service Awarding is held every year during its Foundation Day ceremonies.  All \\nemployees, Teaching and Non -teaching, who have rendered 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 years of \\nfulltime service are recognized.  \\nCommendation awards for exemplary/excellent performance may also be given to deserving employees \\nduring this event.

It is also reflective of the \\nvalues the school promotes among its people. National University fairly and justly compensates the official \\npresence of the faculty consistent with government r ules and regulations. HR shall maintain an accurate \\nrecord of daily attendance which forms the basis of the faculty’s corresponding pay during a given period.  \\n \\nSECTION 2:  WORK SCHEDULE  \\n2.1 Work Schedule . Teaching personnel shall report for work according to the class schedule given to \\nthem by the Program Chair/Coordinators/Director, which shall be the basis for the computation of \\nthe monthly pay.   \\n \\n2.1.1 A Full -Time Faculty (regular and probationary) is paid based on monthly rates which one is \\nexpected to:  \\na. Render forty (40) residency hours per week;  \\nb. Teach fifty -four (54) credit units a year usually divided into 18 credit units per term.  \\n \\n2.1.2 A Part -time faculty pay is based on hourly rates depending on rank and is released bi -monthly \\nwithin the term under these conditions:  \\na. Part-time contracts are on a term basis;  \\nb. Part-time faculty members shall be paid on the days actually worked. In the event classes \\nare called off due to force majeure or as declared by the University, there being no work, \\npart-time faculty members shall not be paid for those particular days . However, regular \\nholidays shall be paid according to the provisions of the Labor Code.  \\n  \\n2.2 Flexible Time Arrangement . All employees shall abide by the work schedule as defined in item 2.1 \\nabove.  However, National University may also allow flexible time for selected employees.  Flexi -time \\nemployees are those who, by the nature of their job, necessarily render flexible t ime.  \\n  \\n2.2.1 Faculty are required to be present for work during the workday established for them by their \\nDean/Program Chair/Coordinator.

National University Teaching Personnel shall have a scheduled one -time 15 minutes paid \\nbreaks per day.  The Unit Director should assign the personnel a staggered schedule of break so the \\nUnit may still be manned, open and function normally throughout the  day.  \\n \\nSECTION 3:  RECORDING HOURS WORKED  \\nAll employees are required to keep a record of hours worked which is the basis of payment of salary.  \\n3.1 All employees, whether ASP or Teaching Personnel, shall record their attendance through the \\nbiometrics finger scanning system.   \\n \\n3.2 Data recorded in the biometrics system shall be the basis for payment of salaries and wages. Each \\nfaculty must register the time he/she arrives in the campus and the time he/she leaves. Thus, a \\ncomplete and valid entry for each day contains the following:  \\n• Time -in   -  to record the time of arrival or start of shift  \\n• Time -out -  to record the time of departure from work or end of shift  \\n \\n3.3 All faculty are expected to adhere to integrity in the recording of the time in and out.  Hence for \\noffenses such as omissions, the employee will be receiving sanctions.  \\n \\n3.3.1 First Omission :  Each employee must have a valid ‘Time in’ or ‘Time out’ entries on the daily \\ntime record. In case either one is missing, the employee must submit a written explanation for \\nnot registering the ‘Time in’ or ‘Time out’ within twenty -four (24) hours.

This also includes all \\ntravels by the messenger, liaison and other p ersonnel tasked to coordinate with the other offices in \\nrelation to the needs of National University, such as but not limited to the Local Government Unit, SM \\noffices, b anks, other campuses among others.  \\n \\n4.1 Reporting  \\nA transaction or travel shall be considered official business when duly reported to the National \\nUniversity.  \\n \\n4.1.1 An employee who will go on OB must apply online two (2) days before the scheduled OB to be \\nduly approved online by the immediate superior and noted by HR.  \\n4.1.2 Where the employee goes straight out to the place of OB, the employee may not log -in for the \\nfirst hour of work in the morning provided the immediate superior approves it. Likewise, \\nlogging -in and out in the afternoon may be waived if there is not enough t ime to report back \\nto work. The attendance of the employee shall be based on the approved OB.  \\n4.1.3 If the OB takes two or more days, the filing of the OB application is five (5) working days from \\nthe date of OB to give the department ample time to adjust affected work schedules.  \\n \\n4.2 Non -compliance to the above requirements shall be construed as an absence or under time on the \\npart of the employee.  \\n \\n4.3 For an \\'Urgent\\' need for an OB, the reason must be stated in the purpose box provided in the form. \\nIn this case, the OB may be filed on the same day.  \\n \\n4.4 Incidental Costs   \\n \\nAny incidental costs occurred during an Official Business representation may be endorsed for \\nreimbursement under the policies set by the Accounting Office.

Regular attendance and punctuality are important for smooth operation of your team \\nand the University as a whole.  Absenteeism causes disrup tions and burdens colleagues.  \\n \\n5.2 The attendance record is part of the performance evaluation rating. It will also be considered for other \\ndisciplinary action, including termination.  Hence, faculty is expected to report on their work on \\nschedule and on time.    \\n \\n5.3 Absence is the failure to report for work due to any reason. Any absence disrupts the smooth flow of \\nwork and unduly increases the burden on the rest of the College /School .  Frequently absenting oneself \\nfrom work justifies corrective measures. Excessive absenteeism and/or tardiness will lead to \\ndisciplinary action, including  termination.  Absence from work for six ( 6) consecutive days without \\nproperly notifying the Dean /Program Chair/ Coordinator is considered  abandonment of work and is \\nsubject to dismissal.  \\n \\n5.4 Absences due to illness, valid personal reasons, emergencies, force majeure may be excused as \\nevaluated and approved by the Dean/Program Chair/Coordinator. The faculty must notify the \\nDean/Program Chair/Coordinator, by any means, on or before the first wor king hour of the day of the \\nimpending absence.  The faculty should file this under the sick leave to be approved by the \\nDean/Program Chair/Coordinator.  \\n \\n5.5 If the immediate supervisor is not available, contact the Human Resources office prior to the start of \\nthe workday and leave a contact number to enable the supervisor to return call .  Failure to properly  \\ninform the supervisor will result to an unexcused absence which is subject to disciplinary measures.  \\n \\n5.6 Absence without authorized leave or failure to file an official leave of absence is inexcusable and shall \\nbe charged against the faculty’s salary.  \\n \\nSECTION 6:  TARDINESS AND UNDERTIME  \\n6.1 Each faculty is important to the overall success of National University operations. When not at one’s \\npost, someone else must do the job. Thus, each one is expected to report for work on time at the \\nscheduled start of the workday. Reporting for work on tim e means that one is ready to start work, not \\njust arriving at the scheduled starting time.  \\n \\n6.2 Habitual tardiness shall adversely affect one’s  performance evaluation and consequently affect \\nchances of promotion, salary increases and continued employment with National University. \\nTardiness  means reporting for work late or beyond the starting time.  \\n \\n6.3 Undertime  means abandonment of work before the dismissal time. Like tardiness, it is a violation of \\nthe rules on work hours. The faculty shall fill up an Undertime Authorization Form and shall be duly Title:  \\nFACULTY  MANUAL  Reference No.  OPR – HRD – D – M – 003 \\nDEPARTMENT  HUMAN RESOURCES  \\nThis is a controlled document.

Sundays are normally the designated rest days for employees. Since rest days are not \\nconsidered paid, any work rendered on such rest days shall be paid in accordance with the Labor Code. \\nThe Dean/Program Chair/Coordinator may require the faculty to work on a rest day on the following \\nconditions based on the provisions of the law:  \\n \\n8.1.1 In case of actual or impending emergencies caused by serious accident, fire, flood, typhoon, \\nearthquake, epidemic or other disaster or calamity to prevent loss of life and property, or \\nimminent danger to the university;  \\n8.1.2 In cases of urgent work to be performed on the machinery, equipment, or installation, to avoid \\nserious loss which the employer would otherwise suffer;  and Title:  \\nFACULTY  MANUAL  Reference No.  OPR – HRD – D – M – 003 \\nDEPARTMENT  HUMAN RESOURCES  \\nThis is a controlled document.

Full -time employees will be paid for the holidays worked provided the  employee \\nwas present on the workday immediately before the holiday or  had an approved leave. If a paid \\nholiday falls within an employee\\'s vacation period, the holiday will not be counted as a vacation leave.  \\n \\n7.4 Pay. Any work performed during the rest day and holidays shall be subject to just and reasonable \\ncompensation as provided for by the Labor Code.  The additional pay shall be applicable to all \\nemployees of National University.  \\n \\nSECTION 8: SUSPENSION OF WORK  \\n8.1 In case of inclement weather when there is no explicit announcement that regular office/ work is \\ncalled off, faculty may opt to use their (emergency) vacation leaves.  \\n \\n8.2 National University strictly follows government directives, announcements and declarations during \\ntyphoons, calamities,  and national emergencies.  \\n \\n8.3 The President or his authorized representative shall have sole discretion to declare suspension of work \\nas the local circumstance warrants. The announcement shall be made thr ough  the HR.  \\n \\nSECTION 9: OFFICIAL TRAVEL POLICY AND GUIDELINES  \\n9.1 Purpose : The Purpose of travel policy is  to ensure that the travel expense of the University is \\ncontrolled by establishing certain standards. Employees must control business travel expense by \\nmaking the sound judgment with respect to the use of University funds.  Travel is an important aspect \\nfor carrying out the business, hence, it is expected from employees that they will follow the \"travel \\nguidelines for employees while  travelling and would provide documentation in support of the same. \\nIt is also meant to reimburse the amount spent by an emplo yee when on international, domestic,  or \\nshort distance travel.  \\n \\n9.2 Scope :  The policy and guidelines include all the employees, non -teaching,  and teaching personnel, of \\nthe University. This includes all local (whether land travel or with air travel) and international travels.  \\nThis also covers the travel policy for short travels to the offices or agencies that the employees need \\nto go to for me etings, seminars, conferences,  and others.

This chapter states the policy on discipline, faculty conduct and behavior, \\ngrievance procedure and the schedule of offenses and the corresponding sanctions.  \\n \\nSECTION 1:  POLICY STATEMENT  \\nIt is the sincere desire of National University to help its faculty in every way possible so that both will \\nsucceed in their respective endeavors, but willful or inexcusable breach of the Code will be dealt with \\nfirmly under a uniform policy such that the provisions of this Code shall apply to all faculty regardless of \\nstatus, rank,  or position.  \\nNational University views disciplinary action more of a correction or preventive measure than a punitive \\none.  National University, in adopting and promulgating these rules and regulations, intend to abort the \\nmisconduct and offenses caused by a minority, if not isolated few, of the faculty. National University does \\nnot in any way want that the great majority of the employees who are performing efficiently and loyally \\nand who make National University a respected organization to feel that the adoption of the se policies is \\nan adverse reflection on them.  \\n \\nSECTION 2:  ETHICAL CONDUCT  \\n2.1 To avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest, faculty are expected to abide by ethical standards \\nand the Code of Ethics of Teachers.  \\n \\n2.2 Faculty should not solicit anything of value from any person or organization with whom the National \\nUniversity has a current or potential business relationship.  \\n \\n2.3 Faculty should not accept any item of value from any party in exchange for or in connection with a \\nbusiness transaction between National University and that other party.  \\n \\n2.4 Faculty may accept items of incidental value from customers, suppliers, or others if the gift is not \\ngiven in response to solicitation of favor and long as it implies no exchange for business any purpose. \\nItems may include gifts, gratuities, food, drink,  and entertainment.  \\n \\n2.5 If faced with and unsure how to handle a situation that may potentially violate this code of ethical \\nconduct, notify the Dean/Program Chair/Coordinator.

OBJECTIVES  \\nThis policy has the following objectives:  \\nA. Evaluate faculty performance based on the faculty’s teaching, research, and community \\nengagement responsibilities.  \\nB. Motivate the faculty to perform to their full potential.  \\nC. Provide the basis for annual merit, renewal of term appointment, appointment to \\nprobationary or permanent status, promotion in rank, and faculty development.  \\n \\nII. SCOPE  \\nThe SPES for Faculty comprises Teaching Effectiveness, Research and Innovation, Community \\nEngagement, and Professional Development.  It applies to all faculty members with term and \\nregular appointments, part -time (PT) and full -time (FT).  For SPES purposes , adjunct faculty will \\nbe evaluated similarly to part -time faculty. The use of the term “college” in this document refers \\nto the colleges in NU Main and the schools in NU campuses.  \\n \\nIII. GENERAL GUIDELINES  \\nA. Each component of the SPES has an allocated maximum point.  Any point in excess from \\neach component is not transferable to other components.  Similarly, each sub -component \\nhas a maximum point allocation, and any point in excess is not transferable to other  sub-\\ncomponents.  \\nB. The minimum SPES rating of a faculty must be equal to or better than the institutional Key \\nPerformance Indicator (KPI) for the Faculty SPES rating for the academic year.  SPES rating \\nfalling below the KPI may be a ground for non -renewal of contract in the case of part -time, \\ncontractual full -time, and probationary full -time faculty or further performance review for \\nregular faculty.   \\nC. For faculty with term appointments, the Teaching Effectiveness rating, particularly the \\nOnline Teachers Evaluation (OTE), maybe a basis for the non -renewal of the contract in the \\nsucceeding term.  \\nD. Details of the activities, accomplishments, engagements, etc., must be listed per component.  \\nSupporting documents must be available for verification upon request.  \\nE. Only activities or undertakings accomplished within the evaluation period must be reflected \\nin the SPES unless indicated.  Any activity or accomplishment should only be reflected or \\ncredited in one component.  \\nF. Submission of the College SPES Summary to the Human Resource Office (HRO) is as follows:  \\n• 15 days after the end of the term for PT faculty  \\n• 30 days after the end of the Academic Year (AY) for FT faculty  \\n \\n \\n Title:  \\nFACULTY  MANUAL  Reference No.  OPR – HRD – D – M – 003 \\nDEPARTMENT  HUMAN RESOURCES  \\nThis is a controlled document.

FREQUENCY  \\nA. The SPES for full -time faculty, whether probationary, contractual, or regular, will be required \\nonce at the end of every academic year.   \\nB. The SPES for part -time faculty will be required at the end of every term.  \\n \\nV. RATING REFERENCE  \\nA. The rating reference for the Faculty SPES is consistent with the instruments used by the \\nUniversity in evaluating the performance of its personnel.  \\nB. Unless otherwise reflected in the Institutional Quality Objectives, a faculty must receive a \\ndescriptive rating of at least “Meets Expectation.”    \\nC. The rating reference is as shown below:  \\n \\nRange  Description  From  To \\n6.51  7.00  Truly Exceptional  \\n6.00  6.50  Excellent  \\n5.00  5.99  Exceeds Expectations  \\n4.00  4.99  Meets Expectation  \\n3.00  3.99  Fairly Satisfactory  \\n2.00  2.99  Unsatisfactory  \\n1.00  1.99  Very Unsatisfactory  \\n \\nVI. SPES COMPONENTS  \\nThe SPES is composed of four (4) areas upon which the performance of the faculty will be \\nevaluated:  \\n• Teaching Effectiveness  \\n• Research and Innovation  \\n• Community Engagement  \\n• Professional Development  \\nAll full -time faculty will be evaluated on the four (4) components.  The part -time faculty \\nconsidering the nature of their engagement with the University, will only be assessed on \\nTeaching Effectiveness.  \\nA.
